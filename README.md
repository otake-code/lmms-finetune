# Enabling the finetuning of the latest Large Multimodal Models


## About

More and more large multimodal models (LMMs) are being released from time to time, but the finetuning of these models is not always straightforward. This codebase aims to provide a unified structure for LMM finetuning. Key design ideas include:
- the components of the finetuning process (e.g., model loading, data collating) are abstracted, allowing one to easily integrate the latest LMMs into this codebase and finetune them with minimal effort;
- for all LMMs the ðŸ¤—huggingface's official implementation is used, so that after finetuning one can do inference and everything else in the exact same way as earlier with the HF model;
- the codebase is kept as simple/lightweight as possible, so that it is easy to understand and modify.


The codebase is quite flexible. Despite being at an early stage, it already supports the finetuning of various types of LMMs, including:
- :city_sunrise: single image models: [LLaVA-1.5](https://huggingface.co/collections/llava-hf/llava-15-65f762d5b6941db5c2ba07e0), [Phi-3-Vision](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct)
- :bookmark_tabs: multiple/interleaved image models: [Qwen-VL-Chat](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat), [LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave](https://huggingface.co/collections/llava-hf/llava-interleave-668e19a97da0036aad4a2f19)
- :movie_camera: video models: [LLaVA-NeXT-Video](https://huggingface.co/collections/llava-hf/llava-next-video-6666a9173a64c7052930f153)

See [supported_models.md](docs/supported_models.md) for the full list of supported models. More models are coming on the way. For training strategy, 1) full-finetuning, 2) lora, and 3) q-lora are supported.

*TODOS:* 
- [x] phi3-v

<summary>What's different from <a href=https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory>LLaMA-Factory</a>?</summary>

As of 2024/07, LLaMA-Factory officially supports only the finetuning of LLaVA-1.5. There are people working on adding more models to LLaMA-Factory, but the process can be a bit complicated given its large scale and complexity (e.g., there will be a lot of detailed considerations and compatibility problems with text-only LLMs to consider; see [this](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/pull/4136) and [this](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/pull/4377)). This is actually one of the motivations for putting up this codebase. It will definitely not be as optimized as LLaMA-Factory, but it is exclusively for multi-modal LLMs and is designed to be lightweight/simple which can best facilitate quick experiments, flexible modifications, and easy integrations of new models (which is quite important given the fast pace of model releases).

## Installation

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/zjysteven/lmms-finetune.git

# set up a conda environment
conda create -n lmms-finetune python=3.10 -y
conda activate lmms-finetune
## this will install the latest version of torch
## feel free to change it to a specific version
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## optionally install flash attention
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation flash-attn
```

<summary><b>1. Prepare your finetuning data</b></summary>

Similar to LLaVA, we expect the data to be in a json file containing a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is a sample.
```json
[
    {
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        "video": "path/to/video1.mp4",
        "num_frames": 10,
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<video>\nWhat is this video about?"
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "This video shows a baby crying."
            },
        ]
    }
]
```
The image and video token is assumed to be `<image>` and `<video>`. We adopt this format for its readability. Our dataset implementation is general enough to support variations within this format, e.g., multiple image/video inputs in a sample. For more details, see the [dataset documentation](docs/dataset.md) where we go over several examples to see how flexible this json file can be.

The actual videos and images can be stored in their corresponding folders, and then the paths in the json file should be relative to the video/image root folder. Or the paths can simply be absolute paths.

<summary><b>2. Perform finetuning</b></summary>

Modify the sample training bash script [example.sh](./example.sh) to specify arguments including the target model, data path, etc. There are comments that explain each argument's meaning. Then simply kick off the training by running the bash script `bash example.sh`.

<details>
<summary><b>3. Inference with finetuned model</b></summary>

The key here is to correctly load the finetuned model, after that everything is the same as how you would do inference with the corresponding model from huggingface. Refer to the [inference documentation](docs/inference.md) for more details.

<details>
<summary>Known limitations</summary>

- :neutral_face: Due to huggingface's implementation (e.g., the vision encoder's hidden states are saved, see [this](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/0fdea8607d7e01eb0e38a1ebeb7feee30a22f0cf/src/transformers/models/llava/modeling_llava.py#L425)), the memory cost can be high especially for full finetuning.
- :neutral_face: Currently all vision modules are freezed for simplicity.
- :warning: Due to [an unsolved issue](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/issues/3156) in deepspeed (all parameters have to be used in the forward pass), currently the training might not succeed if you have text-only data in your dataset.
